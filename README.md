## BEST PLACE FINDER

---

This project is a research app developed with React. 

For the moment you can research all the place you want (like dentist, restaurant, Museum ...) in all the cities that's you want.

The results will be displayed by 'Best Match', 'Highest Rated' & 'Most reviewed'.
Search results are obtained via the Yelp API ( Many Thanks).
In the near future, other APIs will complete the project.
